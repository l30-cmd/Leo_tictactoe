One-dimensional tic-tac-toe

You plan your 1D tic-tac-toe on a board that has one row with 20 spaces.

There are two players. The first player makes a move by placing an x into an empty space. The second player places an o. Then the first player plays again.

For example:

    move: -------x------------
    move: -------x--o---------
    move: -------xx-o---------
    move: -------xxoo---------
    move: ------xxxoo---------

The player who places three of their own marks next to each other wins.

Your task is to program the game!
